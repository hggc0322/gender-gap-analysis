    "Challenge Name: BWWC: Hack the Gender Wage Gap - UK Data Challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "Description: \n",
    "This project is sponsored by the Boston Womenâ€™s Workforce Council, a public-private partnership between the City of Boston, Boston University, and over 200 companies in Boston.\n",
    "\n",
    "In 2017 the UK was the first government in the world to require organizations with more than 250 employees to make wage data public. The findings showed a persistent pay gap among 77% of the reporting employers stated that median hourly pay was higher for men than for women in their organisation. We want to better understand these data to inform the creation of policies that could reduce this wage gap.\n",
    "\n",
    "### This is an incredible opportunity to understand what might be driving factors to the overall gender wage gap. We want students to analyze this data, combine it with other public data and help us understand what the US can learn from the UK open data set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Examples of possible factors of interest could be:\n",
    "Industry and Job characteristics (e.g. historically male role, male-dominated industry, role level - e.g. low wage vs. professional, etc.)\n",
    "Leadership characteristics (e.g. number or percentage of women in executive level or C-suite roles - CEO, etc., number or percentage of women on the board, etc.)\n",
    "Employer provided benefits (e.g. family leave, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the UK government has already performed substantial analysis related to characteristics of employees (full time, male/femaie, etc.) We are looking for correlations specifically to employer practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "If time, allows, we hope these data can be presented in a visually compelling and even interactive way.  For access to the datasets visit: https://tinyurl.com/techtogetherbwwc\n",
    "r\n",
    "Criteria: \n",
    "Analysis: the hack with the most insightful analysis on employer factors related to the pay gap\n",
    "Usefulness: the hack provides data in a format that can be used for further analysis\n",
    "Presentation: the hack presents the data or findings in a compelling manner \n",
